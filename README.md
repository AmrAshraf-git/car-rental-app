## Overview
This client-server application is a part of an online system called **Vehicle Rental System** that consists of [this app](https://github.com/AmrAshraf-git/car-rental-app) in addition to ![a website]("https://") that has all the app's features in addition to an admin tool (dashboard) for owners. The main idea of this system is to connect all vehicle rental companies with any user online. Thus, each company can show its products *(ex: cars)* online to all users via the owner's account on the website, which in this case is considered an admin tool (dashboard). On the other hand, users can browse, get company locations, rent, and more through this application or the website.
